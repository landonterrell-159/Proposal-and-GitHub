# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

 Tron Arena

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

 Its going to be a game where you move a tron bike that leaves a trail almost like snake, trying to cut off and eliminate other opponents. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

For my project, I will be developing a Tron-inspired game in Roblox using Roblox Studio and its scripting language, Lua. The software will include core features such as team selection, background music, and fast moving bikes capable of making sharp 90-degree turns similar to the light cycles in Tron and mechanics of snake. I will also design custom suits for players to wear. The game will be executed entirely in Roblox Studio. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable
## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.



## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My Next steps are to be able to understand LUA. I have never used it beofre and now Im going to have to learn it and understand its core functions and how to apply it to roblox. Im also going to have to learn how to build the actual physical properties of the game. I Have to learn how to use its building and creation tools.
